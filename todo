- make all types store resolution (as an array) rather than dimensions (as a list). All the x-dimensions functions will become slow array->list funcs. We will use the resolution exclusively internally

- √ find all uses of fixnum and replace with something more sensible

- work through the perf logs micro-optimizing

- use with-cepl-context in all major macros

- make the map-g context into the cepl-context

- take CEPL.PIPELINES::UNIFORM-MATRIX-4FT and change to sending values rather than ptr. Profile the result.
