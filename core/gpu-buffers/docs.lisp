  (defstruct gpu-buffer
    "
`gpu-buffer` is a struct that abstracts a OpenGL 'Buffer Object'

Along with the the ID of the GL Object itself it stores the unformatted data
as an array of `gpu-array`s.

Every `gpu-array` in the buffer will have an element-type of :uint8, even if this
buffer was created for a `gpu-array` with a different element-type.

For example:

    (make-gpu-array '(.1 .2 .3 .4))

will make a `gpu-array` of 4 floats. However the buffer backing this `gpu-array`
will contain a single array with element-type :uint8 and a length of 16.

It is not expected that users will be using `gpu-buffer`s directly. Instead they
are ususal interacted with via CEPL's `gpu-array` and ubo features.

  (defun gpu-buffer-p
      "
This function returns t if the given value is a `gpu-buffer`. Otherwise it
returns nil.
")

  (defun gpu-buffer-arrays
      "
This function returns an array of the raw :uint8 `gpu-array`s that make up the
data in this `gpu-buffer`.
")

  (defun gpu-buffer-id
      "
This function, when passed a `gpu-buffer` will return the OpenGL buffer object
from the `gpu-buffer`.

It is not recommended to modify this directly as the changes from doing so won't
be reflected in the layout of the `gpu-buffer`, which may potentially put the
`gpu-buffer` (and and `gpu-array` or `ubo` using it) into an invalid state.
")


  (defun make-gpu-buffer
      "
This function creates and returns a new `gpu-buffer`.


If you wish to populate the buffer during construction you can pass a `c-array` as
the :initial-contents.


The :usage argument is a hint to OpenGL on how you intend to use the `gpu-buffer`.
It is optional whether your gpu manufacturer's implementation of GL takes any
notice of this option. When they do take notice of it, it will to optimize
access to the underlying data.


The :target argument can take any of the following binding targets:

    Buffer Binding Target      Purpose
    -------------------------------------------------------------
    :array-buffer              Vertex attributes
    :atomic-counter-buffer     Atomic counter storage
    :copy-read-buffer          Buffer copy source
    :copy-write-buffer         Buffer copy destination
    :dispatch-indirect-buffer  Indirect compute dispatch commands
    :draw-indirect-buffer      Indirect command arguments
    :element-array-buffer      Vertex array indices
    :pixel-pack-buffer         Pixel read target
    :pixel-unpack-buffer       Texture data source
    :query-buffer              Query result buffer
    :shader-storage-buffer     Read-write storage for shaders
    :texture-buffer            Texture data buffer
    :transform-feedback-buffer Transform feedback buffer
    :uniform-buffer            Uniform block storage

Do note that the default of :array-buffer is perfectly fine for creating the
`gpu-buffer` and uploading the data. It does not limit how the buffer can be used
in future parts of your program.
