  (defstruct sampler
    "
As `sampler` is a structure which we pass to the a gpu-pipeline to specify how the
pipeline should read from a particular `texture` (also known as sampling the
texture).

They are created by calling `sample` on a texture. You can then modify the
various parameters and the pass the sampler to a pipeline as a uniform.

Sampling Parameters cover four main aspects of how the values are read:

- Wrapping
- Filtering
- LOD
- Comparison


We will dive into these topics below.

**-- Note for beginners --**

This area of GL can be incredibly confusing so don't worry if you don't grasp
it immediately. Lots can be done without messing with these values, tackle each
one when you have a usecase for it.


**-- Wrapping --**

When using normalized texture coordinates we are used to thinking about our
coordinate being between 0s0 and 1s0 and that value dictating where we are
sampling from.

However normalized texture coordinates are not limited to values between
0s0 and 1s0. They can be any floating-point number.

When a texture coordinate is not within the 0 → 1 range, some means must be
employed to decide what the color value will be.

The different approaches are as follows:

    :repeat: the texture coordinate wraps around the texture. so a texture
             coordinate of -0.2 becomes the equivalent of 0.8.

    :mirrored-repeat: the texture coordinate wraps around like a mirror.
                      -0.2 becomes 0.2, -1.2 becomes 0.8, etc.

    :clamp-to-edge: the texture coordinate is clamped to the 0 → 1 range.

    :clamp-to-border: the texture coordinate is clamped to the 0 → 1
                      range, but the edge texels are blended with a
                      constant border color.

    :mirror-clamp-to-edge: (only available with OpenGL 4.4 or
                           :arb-texture-mirror-clamp-to-edge) the texture
                           is clamped to the -1 → 1 range, but mirrors the
                           negative direction with the positive. Basically,
                           it acts as :clamp-to-edge, except that it
                           takes the absolute value of the texture
                           coordinates before clamping.

This also applies to Rectangle Textures, except that the range at which they
apply edge sampling is based on the texel width/height of the texture, not
the normalized 0 → 1 range.

This does not apply to Buffer Textures, as they must use the texelFetch sampling
functions and thus cannot sample outside of the texel range of the texture.

example:

    (setf (wrap texture-or-sampler)
          #(:clamp-to-edge :repeat-to-edge :clamp-to-edge))

    (setf (wrap texture-or-sampler) :clamp-to-edge)



**-- Filtering --**

Filtering is the process of accessing a particular sample from a `texture`.

There are two cases when filtering is relevant: minification and magnification.

Magnification means that the area of the fragment in texture space is smaller
than a texel, and minification means that the area of the fragment in texture
space is larger than a texel.

Filtering for these two cases can be set independently.

The magnification filter is controlled by the :magnify-filter texture parameter.
This value can be :linear or :nearest.

If :nearest is used, then the implementation will select the texel nearest the
texture coordinate; this is commonly called 'point sampling').

If :linear is used, the implementation will perform a weighted linear blend
between the nearest adjacent samples.

    (setf (magnify-filter tex-or-sampler) :linear)
    (setf (magnify-filter tex-or-sampler) :nearest)


The minification filter is controlled by the :texture-min-filter texture
parameter. To understand these values better, it is important to discuss what
the particular options are. Here is the full list:

    :nearest                 :linear
    :nearest-mipmap-nearest  :nearest-mipmap-linear
    :linear-mipmap-nearest   :linear-mipmap-linear

When doing minification, you can choose to use mipmapping or not. Using
mipmapping means selecting between multiple mipmaps based on the angle and size
of the texture relative to the screen. Whether you use mipmapping or not,
you can still select between linear blending of the particular layer or nearest.
And if you do use mipmapping, you can choose to either select a single mipmap to
sample from, or you can sample the two adjacent mipmaps and linearly blend the
resulting values to get the final result.

The OpenGL minification settings for these are as follows:

    Param Setting            Lin within mip-level
    :nearest                 No
    :linear                  Yes
    :nearest-mipmap-nearest  No
    :linear-mipmap-nearest   Yes
    :nearest-mipmap-linear   No
    :linear-mipmap-linear    Yes

    Param Setting            Has mipmapping
    :nearest                 No
    :linear                  No
    :nearest-mipmap-nearest  Yes
    :linear-mipmap-nearest   Yes
    :nearest-mipmap-linear   Yes
    :linear-mipmap-linear    Yes

    Param Setting            Linear between mip-levels
    :nearest                 -
    :linear                  -
    :nearest-mipmap-nearest  No
    :linear-mipmap-nearest   No
    :nearest-mipmap-linear   Yes
    :linear-mipmap-linear    Yes

Remembering these combinations can be annoying so CEPL provides an additional
function called #'set-minify-filter see the docstring for details

examples:

    (setf (minify-filter tex-or-sampler) :linear)
    (setf (minify-filter tex-or-sampler) :nearest-mipmap-nearest)
    (setf-minify-filter tex-or-sampler :nearest :nearest)


**-- LOD --**

There is a pair of sampling parameters that affect the mipmap image selection:
:max-lod and :min-lod (floating-point values).

The way these work in mipmap selection is quite complicated; the specification
goes into full detail about it.

example:

    (setf (min-lod texture-or-sampler) value)
    (setf (max-lod texture-or-sampler) value)


LOD bias:
The mipmap image selection process can be adjusted coarsely by using the
:lod-bias sampling parameter. This bias will be added to the mipmap
LOD calculation (as well as added to the bias specified in one of the `texture`
accessing functions in GLSL), which is used to select the image. A positive bias
means that larger mipmaps will be selected even when the texture is viewed from
farther away. This can cause visual aliasing, but in small quantities it can
make textures a bit more sharp.

    (setf (lod-bias texture-or-sampler) value)


**-- Comparison --**

-WARNING-

This feature is currently unsupported until shadow samplers are more fully
tested in CEPL. Use at your own risk


Depth `texture`s (textures that have a depth component image format) can be
sampled in one of two ways. They can be sampled as a normal texture, which
simply retrieves the depth value (with filtering applied). This will return a
vec4 containing a single floating-point value.

They can also be fetched in comparison mode. This means that sampling from
the texture requires a value to compare to those pulled from the texture;
this value is called the reference value. The result of the comparison
depends on the comparison function set in the texture. If the function
succeeds, the resulting value is 1s0; if it fails, it is 0s0.

When linear filtering is used, the actual returned value is
implementation-defined. However, the value will be on the range 0 → 1 and
will be proportional to the number of neighboring texels that pass the
comparison based on the single given value.

If the texture is a normalized integer depth format, then the reference value
is clamped to 0 → 1, to match the values from the texture. Otherwise, the value
is not clamped.

Using this mode requires two special settings. First, the `sampler` used in GLSL
must be a shadow sampler. Second, the texture used in that sampler must have
activated depth comparison mode. Attempting to use a texture without comparison
with a shadow sampler, or vice-versa, will result in an error upon rendering.

To set the texture to comparison mode, set the :texture-compare-mode
texture parameter to :compare-ref-to-texture. The comparison function to
use when comparing the reference to the texture is set with the
:texture-compare-func texture parameter. Acceptable values are:

    :never (always fails)
    :always (always succeeds)
    :less
    :lequal
    :equal,
    :not-equal
    :gequal
    :greater

The comparison works as follows:

    (funcall operator ref texture)

Where ref is the reference value given to the texture lookup function by
GLSL, and texture is the value fetched from the texture. So :LESS will be
true if the reference value is strictly less than the value pulled from the
texture.
")

  (defun sample
      "
This function takes a `texture` and optionally some sampling parameters and
returns a `sampler`.

The sampler is an object that is passed to a pipeline so that the shaders in
the gpu-functions in the pipeline can read from the gpu-arrays in the texture.

For details on what the parameters are and mean see the docstring for the
'sampler type

**-- Note about GL Versions --**

Sampler Objects were introduced in GL 3.3. So for now CEPL needs at least v3.3
in future we hope to lower the requirement to 3.1 but this will take some extra
work.

**-- NOTE For those with GL experience --**

You will have noticed that in CEPL your sampler is tied to one texture which is
unlike in regular GL where a sample object can be used to override the sampling
parameters of any number of textures. At first this would seem very wasteful
however CEPL does not use 1 GL Sampler Object per CEPL sampler. The ID sharing
is done based on the parameters.

This means you get the same number of sampler objects as your would normally
but with the added benefit that samplers are semantically dual with buffer-streams
giving greater api consistancy.

When using normalized texture coordinates we are used to thinking about our
coordinate being between 0s0 and 1s0 and that value dictating where we are
sampling from.

However normalized texture coordinates are not limited to values between
0s0 and 1s0. They can be any floating-point number.

When a texture coordinate is not within the 0 → 1 range, some means must be
employed to decide what the color value will be.

The different approaches are as follows:

    :repeat: the texture coordinate wraps around the texture. so a texture
             coordinate of -0.2 becomes the equivalent of 0.8.

    :mirrored-repeat: the texture coordinate wraps around like a mirror.
                      -0.2 becomes 0.2, -1.2 becomes 0.8, etc.

    :clamp-to-edge: the texture coordinate is clamped to the 0 → 1 range.

    :clamp-to-border: the texture coordinate is clamped to the 0 → 1
                      range, but the edge texels are blended with a
                      constant border color.

    :mirror-clamp-to-edge: (only available with OpenGL 4.4 or
                           :arb-texture-mirror-clamp-to-edge) the texture
                           is clamped to the -1 → 1 range, but mirrors the
                           negative direction with the positive. Basically,
                           it acts as :clamp-to-edge, except that it
                           takes the absolute value of the texture
                           coordinates before clamping.

This also applies to Rectangle Textures, except that the range at which they
apply edge sampling is based on the texel width/height of the texture, not
the normalized 0 → 1 range.

This does not apply to Buffer Textures, as they must use the texelFetch sampling
