;; this could be hard. Do we bind the the lexical entity or the value
;; it really should be the value but place isnt a 'real' object just 
;; a semantic effect
(drelease (pos entity))

;; dbind should return a handle to the call back then you can 

(with-dvalue (dtest)
  (loop :for entity :in entities :do
     (setf (slot entity) (dbind (pos entity) (v! (sin (+ i dtest))
                                                 (cos (+ i dtest)))))))

;; and then entity's slot will hold a key
;; then you can do this 
(drelease (slot entity) dtest)

;; that should be it

;; wait why do we need with-dvalue? because otherwise we have no way to find
;; which form in the dbind is important
