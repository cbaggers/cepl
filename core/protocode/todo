sdl has hardcoded gl version fix this

-----

element-type for texture

-----

unless overriden, when creating a cube map texture set the wrapping to clamp-to-edge

-----

allow setting name for progress var

-----

normalize value when set dir camera

-----

cepl's ability to 'continue' seems hampered on osx, sdl2s restart is confusing

-----

q:make-quat-from-fixed-angles is broken, weird scaling and shit

-----

defun-g should check if arg types are quoted, error if they are

-----

* check qualifiers are valid in varjo
* inherit qualifiers from previous stage
* uniforms saying arg incompatible for basic changes...merge 'em

-----

* get gamepad input stable
* optimize the vector/matrix/quaternion functions
* live version of tdefun

-----

* Object that represents the opengl state machine. Directly address slots etc
* Copy between buffer (gpu-arrays)
* Research safe foreign data initialisation so an error doesnt cause a memrory leak
  look at with-foreign-object for hints
* read http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Buffer_Object and look at the buffer corruption section

-----

* make-gpu-array with list is failing
  ok at really odd  times so is from gl-array... this is odd
  seems to be when created using defparameter...so it doesnt like
  top level for some reason?
- Something to do with null lexical environment

* add set culling? combined enabling, setting winding-order and
  cull-face in one move.

* stream could have base offset so draw-element-base thingy works

* enable is odd.... can things be made better by spinning out
  it's functionality to other functions?

* uniform buffer objects

* deletion of things in pools in jungl

* :triangle, :lines, etc are called the render-mode or primitive
   do our arg names reflect this?

* bindbufferrange - read about it

* work through the glossaries of arc-synth and check args names
   in jungl for conformance

* Render buffers...not urgent in any way but we should support them
  I'm thinking that if a strict subset of the commands that work on
  fbos work on render buffers, then I will make them a special case
  of fbo.

* Default framebuffer should appear to be a user fbo including attachment names
  No sense having this forward backward crap unless it provides something
  real I dont know about yet.

* GL-Free for attachments
