  "Vertex Specification Main article: Vertex Specification

   The process of vertex specification is where the application sets up
   an ordered list of vertices to send to the pipeline. These vertices
   define the boundaries of a primitive.

   Primitives are basic drawing shapes, like triangles, lines, and
   points. Exactly how the list of vertices is interpreted as primitives
   is handled via a later stage.

   This part of the pipeline deals with a number of objects like Vertex
   Array Objects and Vertex Buffer Objects. Vertex Array Objects define
   what data each vertex has, while Vertex Buffer Objects store the
   actual vertex data itself.

   A vertex's data is a series of attributes. Each attribute is a small
   set of data that the next stage will do computations on. While a set
   of attributes do specify a vertex, there is nothing that says that
   part of a vertex's attribute set needs to be a position or
   normal. Attribute data is entirely arbitrary; the only meaning
   assigned to any of it happens in the vertex processing stage."
